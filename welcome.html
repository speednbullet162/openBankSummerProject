				Welcome to the interactive sandbox for the Openbank Projects APIS. This was developed by Beau Breard under instruction
				from Dr. Solomon Negash at Kennesaw State University. The goal of this is provide an easy way for students to interact
				with the API without having knowledge of coding, in the hopes that they will develop a better understanding of how the
				underpinnings of the Financial institution works and communicates with one another. To achieve this all the code is
				handled for the student leaving only fill in the blank sections that will return a formatted section with some of the
				key aspects of the return statement and a section for the raw return information from the API.
